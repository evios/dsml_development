data load
	shuf (unix cli command to read few samples, but not entire file) - FastAI Lection #3
		evaluate types within small dataset
		types = {'id':'int' 64, item_nbr=int32, ...}
	read_csv(dtypes=types)



??VectorAssembler (X_features separation from y)

correlation
	plot

clean
	Outliers

DF concatenation (train+test)
	Y creation
		Drop Y from train
	remember where to divide before modeling

clean
	drop
	fillna
	impute


categorical to numberical

normalize
	StandardScaler

split train-test
	Ensambling/Bagging

model selection
	select small subset from whole subset to speed up
	fit
		%time - count time for command
			#prun - wich line of code behind the scene takes how much time 
				make recurring commands outside of fit ((Profiling)), eg DF to float32


evaluate
???	evaluator - BinaryClassificationEvaluator
	oob score
	evaluate how good is yours validation set (part of train data)
		try to submit few times (4-5) and compare (plot) correlation between your predicted scores and Kaggle actual scores
			Correlation should be linear without ouliers! 
			if no - change validational dataset
			If data - chose latest for validation (not randomly chosen data points)


predict
	with full training set
